# Iris flowers classification project

This is iris flowers classification problem. 

Firstly, I visualized the data. Secondly, I did a classifier which allows the user to input own values of sepal and petal lenght and width in order to predict the class of the iris flower. 

You can download the code and run it on your computer in order to input your own values of sepal and petal lenght and width. The classifier, with the use of KNN model, will predict the class of the iris flower.

This is my first project with the use of machine learning concepts, so any comments are welcome!
