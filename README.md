# Iris flowers classification project
This is iris flowers classification problem. In this project I was trying to firstly visualize data a bit. Then I did a classifier which allows the user to input own values of sepal and petal lenght and width in order to predict the class of the iris flower. 

This is my first project with the use of machine learning concepts, so any comments are welcome!
